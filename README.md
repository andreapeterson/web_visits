# web_visits

Python/Flask web application that tracks + displays the number of visits using Redis as a data store via Docker Compose. Playing around with Docker compose again and freshening up on testing connections between 2 separate services.Docker Compose really simplifies the setup by managing multiple containers and their dependencies. The main key of the connection is in the main.yaml I used the host name of the name of the redis container in 'docker-compose.yaml'.
